# Omni GPU Deep Dive

## Overview

The kernel, overlap, and fuse analysis is not in this repo. It lives in the
`llm-torch-profiler-analysis` skill:

- https://github.com/BBuf/AI-Infra-Auto-Driven-SKILLS

Source attribution for `sglang_omni/` and `sglang_omni_router/` is part of that
skill as of its PR #96, so nothing here patches it. This skill owns three things:

- the backend pointer and its capability check
- the mapping/formal trace pair and its steady-state gates,
  [scripts/omni_trace_pair.py](scripts/omni_trace_pair.py)
- the workload contract and the omni reading rules, this file

Omni is not a separate framework to the backend. It serves through the SGLang
runtime, so always pass `--framework sglang`. The backend's SGLang live-capture
path does not work against an omni server: omni's `/start_profile` takes
`run_id` and `trace_path_template` and stops on `/stop_profile`, while the
backend sends `output_dir` and `num_steps` and waits for a step count. Capture
locally, then analyze the finished traces.

## Backend

```bash
export OMNI_PROFILER_BACKEND=/path/to/AI-Infra-Auto-Driven-SKILLS/skills/llm-torch-profiler-analysis
grep -q sglang_omni "$OMNI_PROFILER_BACKEND/scripts/profile_common.py" \
  || { echo "backend predates BBuf #96; omni frames will not be attributed"; exit 1; }
```

A hard exit, because the failure is quiet. An older backend still runs and still
prints three tables, but its path allowlist knows `python/sglang/`
and not `sglang_omni/`, so an omni frame loses to the torch frame that launched
the kernel and the overlap table's scope degrades to `torch/nn/modules/linear.py`
and friends. The kernel table may survive on a fallback that ranks any python
frame above a torch runtime frame - luck, not the allowlist. Verify the backend
rather than trust output that looks fine.

## The One Rule

**Two traces, two questions. Never conclude from one.**

| | CUDA graph | `with_stack` | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mapping` | off | on | *where* - which python line owns this kernel |
| `formal` | on (real serving config) | off | *how much* - the time a user pays |

A python stack exists only when the launch is a real python call, so graph-on can
never name your code, and graph-off timings are not the ones you ship. Take
location from `mapping`, every number from `formal`, and conclude only when a
kernel is heavy in `formal` *and* attributed in `mapping`.

## Main Flows

### 1. Capture the pair

Run from the repo root, in the environment that serves omni, where `sglang_omni`
and `sglang` are both importable:

```bash
python3 my_workload.py --output-dir .profiling-runs/<run>/
```

`my_workload.py` is one throwaway script per stage, roughly 100 lines with
argparse, not committed. It builds the module, builds one realistic input, and
hands `capture_pair` two callables running *the same work* eager and in the real
serving config:

```python
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, ".claude/skills/omni-gpu-deep-dive/scripts")
from omni_trace_pair import capture_pair

capture_pair(
    output_dir=args.output_dir,                  # str or Path, both coerced
    mapping_body=lambda: encoder(features),      # eager, no graph, no compile
    formal_body=lambda: runner.run(features),    # what production runs
    iters=args.iters,
    warmup=args.warmup,
)
```

`capture_pair` writes `<output-dir>/mapping` and `<output-dir>/formal`, sets
`SGLANG_TORCH_PROFILER_WITH_STACK` per side, waits for `TorchProfiler`'s
background gzip, and gates each trace. It calls `torch.cuda.synchronize()` and
expects gzipped traces, so it is CUDA-only; `TorchNPUProfiler` returns an
uncompressed path.

Rules for the body:

- **Random weights are fine only where shapes follow the graph.** For a fixed
  dataflow stage - conv, attention, GEMM on a known shape - attribution and
  kernel shapes come from the module graph and the input shape, not the values.
  They do not where routing is value dependent: MoE expert selection
  (`ming_omni`, `qwen3_omni`'s thinker, `ming_tts`, `zonos2`) picks which experts
  run, so random weights give a per-expert token distribution, and therefore a
  grouped-GEMM shape mix, that nobody serves. Use real weights for those, and
  say in the report which kind of stage it was.
- **Capture and compile *before* `capture_pair`.** One-time work inside the
  profiled window is what the gate exists to reject.
- **One realistic shape per run.** Omni stages are bucketed; a shape nobody
  serves produces a kernel mix nobody pays for.
- **Same work on both sides.** If `formal_body` covers less than `mapping_body`,
  the shares are not comparable.

To capture from a running omni server instead:

- **Use the graph toggle the profiled stage declares.** `engine.*` exists only on
  stages that drive an SGLang engine, so `<stage>.engine.disable_cuda_graph` is a
  `ConfigPathError` anywhere else. A non-engine stage keeps its own switch under
  `factory.*`: Fun-CosyVoice3's vocoder is
  `--vocoder.factory.enable_flow_cuda_graph false`, while its AR stage is
  `--tts-engine.engine.disable_cuda_graph true`. Read the stage's config class
  before assuming a name.
- Export `SGLANG_TORCH_PROFILER_WITH_STACK=1` before the server starts, and
  `SGLANG_TORCH_PROFILER_DIR` unless the request carries `trace_path_template`.
- Warm the server, `/start_profile`, send few requests - stages sharing a process
  share a trace - let them **finish**, then `/stop_profile`. `Trace exported to`
  is logged before the background `gzip` finishes, and the `.gz` exists while it
  is still partial. The trace is complete when the sibling `.trace.json` is
  gone; wait for that, as `await_compression` does, before analyzing.
- Nothing on this path calls `assert_steady_state`, so gate the traces yourself.

### 2. Analyze the pair

```bash
python3 "$OMNI_PROFILER_BACKEND/scripts/analyze_llm_torch_profile.py" \
  --framework sglang \
  --mapping-input .profiling-runs/<run>/mapping \
  --formal-input  .profiling-runs/<run>/formal \
  | tee .profiling-runs/<run>/report.md
```

The three tables go to stdout and nowhere else; the backend's `--output-dir` is
where a `--url` capture lands, and is ignored with `--*-input`. Every other
backend flag applies, including `--kernel-table-limit`, `--pid-substring`,
`--merge-profiles`, and single-trace `--input`. Nothing under `.profiling-runs/`
is committed.

## Gates

**Before** - `capture_pair` warms up, then refuses any trace containing a Dynamo
or Inductor compile or a CUDA graph capture (`assert_steady_state`). One-time
cost charged to a steady-state kernel is the most common way a run reaches a
confident wrong answer. Warm every shape bucket until the gate passes; never
subtract the cost afterwards.

It rejects compiling and capturing, not *compiled* or *captured execution*, and
that line is narrow: `cudaGraphLaunch` fills a healthy formal trace,
`is_torchdynamo_compiling` is called by every HF forward, and
`torch/_inductor/output_code.py` is how compiled code is *entered*. So the
markers name compile-side subpaths only - a gate that fails clean runs gets
bypassed, which is worse than none. Those subpaths are python frames, absent
from a `formal` trace, so there the gate rests on plain events instead: Dynamo's
`(dynamo_timed)` regions, module loads, and `Lazy Function Loading`. A failure
prints each match with category and timestamp: matches at the window start mean
an unwarmed shape bucket, matches across it mean a recompile every call.

`Lazy Function Loading` is the one ambiguous marker: it also fires on the first
use of an ordinary kernel, so a clean `mapping` trace can carry a few. It is
fatal only where stacks are off, which is where nothing else would catch a cold
compile; with stacks on, a compile matches a path marker too, so the gate prints
the loads and the run continues. Read that note as warmup you could remove, not
as a result to explain away. A server-captured trace gated by hand takes the
strict reading unless you pass `with_stack=True`.

**After** - accept a change on the `formal` config only. Mapping-trace deltas
prove nothing about serving, because the graph replaces the launch path the
mapping trace measured.

- Correctness before speed: fix the input and measure the *base's own*
  run-to-run output variance first, or you cannot tell a regression from
  nondeterminism the base already had.
- Then performance, graph-on: **A/A** first, base against base, for the noise
  floor, then a **paired A/B in both orders**. If the orders disagree, you
  measured drift - warm-up, clocks, other tenants - not your change.
- **Prove the flag you toggled is on the executed path.** A startup log saying a
  backbone compiled or a graph captured proves the wrapper was installed, not
  that serving calls it: a stage that reimplements a forward over the same
  submodules bypasses a wrapper on that forward, silently, and the log still says
  success. Cheapest proof is a `mapping` trace that names the wrapped function.
  Without it, a measured delta belongs to the run, not to the flag.

## Reading The Report

- **Kernel table, "Python location"** is the answer to "which code". Trust it.
  Multiple sites with shares mean one kernel shape is reached from several call
  sites, such as a GEMM used by `fc1`/`fc2` and by `qkv_proj`. That is
  information, not noise.
- **`transformers/models/...` there is a real answer, not a failure.** Plenty of
  omni stages keep their compute in a vendored HF module and contribute only the
  graph runner and the scheduler around it; there the transformers line owns the
  kernel and is the line to edit. Same for `torchaudio/`. What you cannot act on
  is a *torch runtime* frame such as `torch/nn/modules/linear.py` or
  `torch/nn/functional.py`: the mapping trace lost the caller, which is a gap and
  not a finding.
- **Overlap table's "Python scope" is a majority vote**, not the kernel table's
  top site: it attributes each launch by time window and reports the most common
  site, so a kernel split `:123` 77% / `:93` 23% can show `:93`. For the line to
  edit, use the kernel table.
- **Fuse table's "Candidate fused Python path"** cites an LLM-oriented catalog of
  upstream `python/sglang/srt/...` paths. The pattern match can be real; the
  destination usually is not omni's.

## Omni-Specific Reality

The LLM north star, "tensor cores never idle", is wrong for most omni stages:

- Feature extraction and vocoder stages are **memory-bound**: conv1d, STFT,
  depthwise, resample. The fix is fusion or fewer passes, not occupancy.
- Streaming vocoder windows are **launch-bound**; the kernel table looks flat and
  cheap while wall clock is launch count and gaps. Read the overlap table's gaps,
  and consider CUDA graphs or coalescing.
- A stage is a **pipeline process**, preprocess / encoder / LLM / vocoder / post,
  not prefill/decode. Profile the slow stage in isolation first; for cross-stage
  handoff use `sglang_omni/profiler/views.py`, not this skill.
- **After `torch.compile`** kernels become `triton_poi_fused_*` with stacks in
  generated code. For the mapping trace, disable compile as well as graphs.

## Where This Sits

Stage 2 of three, and worth little without the other two. `model-profiling` owns
stage 1 and the record of the outcome - it plans the run, gets human
confirmation, tracks findings - so start there and come back to it with the
answer.

1. **Triage** - find the slow *stage* before any profiler: `model-profiling`'s
   `METHODOLOGY.md`, layers 1 and 2.
2. **GPU deep dive** - this skill: one stage, one shape, the trace pair, the
   kernel table's python location. Escalate to `nsys` for SM headroom only when
   the report leaves no clear change point.
3. **Validation** - the **After** gate above.

## Output Contract

Return:

- **the runtime SHA and the skill SHA, separately.** Checking out a branch to
  load this skill does not make that branch the runtime under test. Unless the
  task names a revision, profile `main` and record both, so a conclusion can be
  pinned to the code it was measured on.
- the mapping and formal trace paths, and the backend path used
- kernel table, overlap-opportunity table, fuse-pattern table
- the `sglang_omni/...:<line>` locations the kernel table attributed, or an
  explicit note that attribution landed on torch runtime frames
- one short summary of what dominates the stage, with the number from `formal`
- which regime the stage is in: compute-bound, memory-bound, or launch-bound
