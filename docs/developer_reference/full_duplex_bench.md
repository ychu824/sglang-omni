# Full-Duplex-Bench v1.5 runbook

This page runs [Full-Duplex-Bench](https://github.com/DanielLin94144/Full-Duplex-Bench) v1.5 against a native full-duplex model served by SGLang-Omni (MiniCPM-o 4.5 by default).

Every step is a subcommand of `python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15`; the code lives in `benchmarks/duplex/fdb_v15/`.

## What is Measured

v1.5 has 498 sample pairs in four categories: `user_interruption` (200), `user_backchannel` (98), `talking_to_other` (100) and `background_speech` (100). Each pair contains two input audio files with the same initial user query. `input.wav` also includes a later speech event intended to overlap with the model's answer: an interruption, a backchannel, speech directed at someone else, or background speech. `clean_input.wav` contains the initial query without that later event. Each file is streamed in a separate session, and the model's output audio is recorded separately.

The pipeline has three steps:

| Step | Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Generate | `generate` | Starts the model server, streams every input to `/v1/realtime`, records the model's audio, stops the server, then cuts a fixed observation window per session |
| 2. ASR | `asr` | Transcribes the input and output audio with word timestamps (Parakeet), then computes VAD speech intervals with the official timing code |
| 3. Judge | `judge` | Starts the judge server, sends the four transcripts of each pair to an LLM with the official prompt, runs the semantic A/F/U judge (Qwen only), stops the server, then writes `summary.json` and `report.txt` |

Every step takes `--run-name` and `--repeat`. A run is one fixed set of pairs under `$FDB_WORK/runs/RUN_NAME`. `--repeat N` does not run the benchmark N times, and it does not mean "repeat three times." One command runs once. The value is only a string inserted into the output path, `$FDB_WORK/runs/RUN_NAME/repeat-N/`, so you can tell that invocation apart from another invocation of the same run. The default is `--repeat 1`, which writes `repeat-1/`. `--repeat 3` still runs once, and it writes `repeat-3/`. To measure variance, invoke the three steps again yourself with a different N (`--repeat 2`, then `--repeat 3`). Each invocation generates the same pairs once; sampling is on, so the generations differ. `aggregate --run-name RUN_NAME` reports the mean ± standard deviation over the finished `repeat-*` directories.

The results are:

- **Stop latency**: how long the model keeps talking while the user talks over it (overlap of merged user and model speech spans). Lower means the model yields sooner. Treat lower as better on `user_interruption`, where the model should give way. On `user_backchannel`, `talking_to_other` and `background_speech` the model should keep its turn, so the overlap length mostly tracks how long that other speech lasts. These are whole-file intervals.
- **Response latency**: time from a user speech span ending to the next model speech start. Lower means the model starts sooner. Treat lower as better when a reply is due. These are whole-file intervals, the same as stop latency.
- **Behavior labels**: the judge assigns each pair one label for how the model handled the overlap. `C_RESPOND` means it addressed the overlap's content. `C_RESUME` means it ignored the overlap and continued. `C_UNCERTAIN_HANDLING` means it asked for a repeat or showed it did not catch the overlap. `C_UNKNOWN` means its reply was off-target or it said nothing. The shares have no single higher-is-better direction. The share that should be high is `C_RESPOND` on `user_interruption`, and `C_RESUME` on `user_backchannel`, `talking_to_other` and `background_speech`. `C_UNKNOWN` should be low. `C_UNCERTAIN_HANDLING` records uncertainty and has no quality direction of its own.
- **Semantic quality** (non-official, `JUDGE=qwen`): a label says what the model did, not whether it was right. A `C_RESUME` that ignored a real interruption and a `C_RESUME` that correctly ignored a backchannel look the same. The semantic judge grades each pair on three axes, each `accept`, `fail` or `unresolved`: `interaction_handling` (did it handle the overlap correctly for its category), `relevance` (did it address the operative request) and `grounding` (no unsupported facts, claimed actions or false memories). `joint` fails if any axis fails and accepts only if all three accept. Every verdict must quote an exact substring of the transcript it relies on; a verdict with a missing or invalid quote becomes `unresolved`, never a pass. Each cell reports `quality = A/(A+F)` and `coverage = (A+F)/N`, where N is every selected pair. Higher quality is better. Higher coverage is better. Read them together: a high quality over a low coverage is a judgment on few pairs.

## Hardware and judge

One GPU with at least 80 GB is enough (H100/200 is recommended). The steps run in turn, and each step starts the server it needs and stops it when it exits.

Two judges are supported, selected by `JUDGE`:

| `JUDGE` | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen` (default) | [Qwen3.8-27B](https://docs.sglang.io/cookbook/autoregressive/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B), served locally by SGLang | Behavior labels: non-thinking, greedy, seeds 1-3. Semantic judge: thinking, temperature 0, seed 1. |
| `gpt` | `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` | The paper's judge. Needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`. |

The semantic judge uses the frozen prompt, response schema and six control cases in `benchmarks/duplex/semantic/`. Before grading, every run sends the six controls and stops if any of the 18 axis statuses differs from `control-expected.json`. Passing the controls is a rubric check, not a measure of judge accuracy.

## One Time Setup

Run these commands from the repository root, with the sglang-omni virtualenv active (`which python` should print that venv's interpreter):

```bash
cd <path/to/sglang-omni>
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 setup
```

`setup` needs `git` and `uv` on `PATH`. It is safe to rerun and skips finished steps. It first installs the `minicpm-o` extra of sglang-omni (`onnx` and `einops`, which the MiniCPM-o server imports) into the active venv, leaving every other package unchanged. Everything else goes under `FDB_WORK` (default `$HOME/fdb`):

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `Full-Duplex-Bench/` | Official scoring code at the pinned revision `3e799c4`; file hashes are checked |
| `dataset/v1.5/` | The four v1.5 subsets, downloaded from the official Google Drive; `dataset/v1.5.revision` holds the archive hash |
| `scoring-venv/` | Python 3.12 with NeMo 3.0.0, torch 2.11 (cu130) and Silero VAD 6.2.1 for ASR and timing |
| `models/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2/` | ASR checkpoint, SHA-256 checked |
| `models/MiniCPM-o-4_5/` | Model under test at revision `503e754`. To reuse an existing copy, symlink it here or set `MODEL_PATH` |
| `models/Qwen3.8-27B/` | Judge checkpoint; its commit is saved in `models/Qwen3.8-27B.revision` |

To change a default, export the variable before running a subcommand. The variables are listed in [Settings](#settings).

## Step 1-3: run the benchmark

Run everything in one terminal in the repository root, with the sglang-omni venv active. Run a preflight first. It takes one pair per category (4 pairs, about 10 minutes end to end, mostly server startup and the semantic judge) and catches environment problems before a long run:

```bash
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 generate --run-name preflight --per-subset 1
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 asr --run-name preflight
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 judge --run-name preflight
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 aggregate --run-name preflight
```

The preflight passes when `generate` prints `{"pass": 8}` and `{"eligible_pairs": 4, ...}`, `asr` prints `{"ok": 16}` and `{"ok": 8}`, and `judge` prints `{"valid": 4}` and `controls: 18/18 axis statuses match`. If anything differs, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

The loop below is an ordinary shell loop. It calls the benchmark three times. `--repeat` does not loop by itself. The first iteration writes `$FDB_WORK/runs/minicpmo-48/repeat-1/`, the second writes `repeat-2/`, and the third writes `repeat-3/`. A later iteration does not overwrite an earlier one.

```bash
for repeat in 1 2 3; do
    python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 generate --run-name minicpmo-48 --repeat "$repeat" --per-subset 12
    python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 asr --run-name minicpmo-48 --repeat "$repeat"
    python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 judge --run-name minicpmo-48 --repeat "$repeat"
done
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 aggregate --run-name minicpmo-48
```

### Choosing pairs

Only `generate` selects pairs; `asr` and `judge` score whatever that repeat recorded. Selection is deterministic, never random: each category takes its first N samples in numeric sample-ID order (1, 2, …, 10, 11, …), so every run and repeat with the same options evaluates the same pairs, and a smaller N is always a prefix of a larger one. The categories hold 200 (`user_interruption`), 98 (`user_backchannel`), 100 (`talking_to_other`) and 100 (`background_speech`) pairs.

| `generate` option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--per-subset N` | N pairs from every category (default 12); `all` selects all 498 |
| `--subset-count CATEGORY=N` | Overrides `--per-subset` for one category; `0` skips it, `all` takes all of it. Repeatable |
| `--sample-id CATEGORY/ID` | Exactly these pairs. Repeatable |
| `--sample-ids-file PATH` | One `CATEGORY/ID` per line, such as another run's `repeat-1/sample-ids.txt` |

```bash
# 20 interruptions, 10 backchannels, no other categories.
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 generate --run-name small --per-subset 0 \
    --subset-count user_interruption=20 --subset-count user_backchannel=10
# The full dataset.
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 generate --run-name minicpmo-full --per-subset all
# Two specific pairs.
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 generate --run-name debug \
    --sample-id user_interruption/1 --sample-id background_speech/7
```

`generate` prints the per-category counts it selected and writes them to `repeat-N/sample-ids.txt`. Every repeat of a run must select the same pairs: a later repeat with a different selection stops with an error, so use a new `--run-name` instead. Pass the same selection options to every repeat.

Approximate wall time per repeat on H200, with one session at a time. Each `generate` adds about 1 minute of model server startup, and each `judge` about 2 minutes of judge server startup:

| Pairs | `generate` | `asr` | `judge` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 48 | ~25 min | ~1 min | ~6 min |
| 498 | ~4 h | ~10 min | ~45 min |

Sessions run in real time (about 15 s each), so generation dominates. Most of `judge` is the semantic judge: thinking-mode batches of up to 8 pairs take about 5 minutes each, and 8 batches run concurrently. `generate --num-shards 2` roughly halves it; read the note on `--num-shards` before using it.

## Results

`aggregate` prints the table and writes it to `$FDB_WORK/runs/RUN_NAME/RESULTS.md`. Each latency and label cell is the mean ± sample standard deviation over the finished repeats; count cells show one value, or a range when repeats differ. This is the validation run (MiniCPM-o 4.5, `--per-subset 3`, two repeats, Qwen judge), so the samples are small:

| Category | Pairs | Timed overlap sessions | Stop latency (s) | Response latency (s) | C_RESPOND | C_RESUME | C_UNCERTAIN_HANDLING | C_UNKNOWN | Judged pairs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| all | 12 | 12 | 1.483 ± 0.070 | 2.698 ± 0.075 | 25.0 ± 11.8% | 66.7 ± 11.8% | 8.3 ± 0.0% | 0.0 ± 0.0% | 12 |
| user_interruption | 3 | 3 | 2.161 ± 0.015 | 2.479 ± 0.128 | 50.0 ± 23.6% | 50.0 ± 23.6% | 0.0 ± 0.0% | 0.0 ± 0.0% | 3 |
| user_backchannel | 3 | 3 | 0.625 ± 0.000 | 2.308 ± 0.121 | 0.0 ± 0.0% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 0.0 ± 0.0% | 0.0 ± 0.0% | 3 |
| talking_to_other | 3 | 3 | 1.751 ± 0.083 | 2.742 ± 0.083 | 33.3 ± 0.0% | 66.7 ± 0.0% | 0.0 ± 0.0% | 0.0 ± 0.0% | 3 |
| background_speech | 3 | 3 | 1.393 ± 0.181 | 3.204 ± 0.034 | 16.7 ± 23.6% | 50.0 ± 23.6% | 33.3 ± 0.0% | 0.0 ± 0.0% | 3 |

- `Pairs` is the selected population. Failed or ineligible sessions stay in it.
- `Timed overlap sessions` is how many overlap sessions produced timing intervals.
- `Judged pairs` is how many pairs got a valid label. The label shares use only these pairs.

With `JUDGE=qwen`, `RESULTS.md` adds a semantic table. From the same validation run:

| Category | interaction_handling quality | interaction_handling coverage | relevance quality | relevance coverage | grounding quality | grounding coverage | joint quality | joint coverage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| all | 73.9 ± 1.6% | 95.8 ± 5.9% | 85.9 ± 5.8% | 87.5 ± 5.9% | 52.2 ± 11.0% | 79.2 ± 5.9% | 32.2 ± 17.3% | 79.2 ± 5.9% |
| user_interruption | 66.7 ± 47.1% | 83.3 ± 23.6% | 66.7 ± 47.1% | 83.3 ± 23.6% | 58.3 ± 11.8% | 83.3 ± 23.6% | 25.0 ± 35.4% | 83.3 ± 23.6% |
| user_backchannel | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 50.0 ± 23.6% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 50.0 ± 23.6% |
| talking_to_other | 50.0 ± 23.6% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 75.0 ± 35.4% | 66.7 ± 0.0% | 58.3 ± 11.8% | 83.3 ± 23.6% | 16.7 ± 23.6% | 83.3 ± 23.6% |
| background_speech | 83.3 ± 23.6% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 16.7 ± 23.6% | 100.0 ± 0.0% | 16.7 ± 23.6% | 100.0 ± 0.0% |

Always read quality together with coverage: a high quality over a low coverage is a judgment on few pairs.

Per-repeat outputs are under `$FDB_WORK/runs/RUN_NAME/repeat-N/`:

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `sample-ids.txt` | The selected pairs |
| `recording/shard-*/` | Raw session traces, input and output audio, protocol reports |
| `reference-audio/` | Fixed-window WAVs used for scoring, plus `reference-manifest.json` with eligibility |
| `scores/summary.json` | Timing, ASR coverage, and (for `JUDGE=gpt`) behavior labels |
| `judge-qwen/summary.json` | Qwen behavior labels (`JUDGE=qwen` only) |
| `semantic-qwen/` | Semantic judge (`JUDGE=qwen` only): `controls/comparison.json`, `inputs.json` (the exact packets sent), `batches/*/` (request, raw response, validated assessments), `quality-outcomes.json` (per-pair axes, joint and any conversion reasons) and `summary.json` |
| `report.txt` | Human-readable coverage, timing and semantic quality report |
| `logs/` | Recorder logs; `scores/logs/` holds ASR and timing logs |

With `JUDGE=qwen`, the "Official behavior label distribution" section of `report.txt` shows `0 / 0` and `not_prepared`. That is expected: that section only counts GPT-4o labels. The Qwen labels are in `judge-qwen/summary.json` and in `RESULTS.md`. The "Custom semantic quality" section of `report.txt` shows the semantic judge for that repeat.

## Settings

Per-run choices (`--run-name`, `--repeat`, pair selection, `--num-shards`) are command options; run any subcommand with `--help` to list them. Machine settings are environment variables, read in `benchmarks/duplex/fdb_v15/common.py`. Run the subcommands with the sglang-omni venv active; that interpreter serves the models and records sessions.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `FDB_WORK` | `$HOME/fdb` | Root for downloads, environments and results |
| `JUDGE` | `qwen` | `qwen` or `gpt` |
| `SERVER_CONFIG` | `examples/full_duplex/minicpmo.yaml` | Server config. Sampling is on, so repeats measure generation variance |
| `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | unset | One GPU index. When set, this chooses the card. Concurrent jobs export different indexes; see [Concurrent runs](#concurrent-runs) |
| `GPU` | `0` | Used only when `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is unset. Must be a single numeric index |
| `SERVER_PORT` / `JUDGE_PORT` | `8097 + 10×GPU` / `30000 + 10×GPU` | Local ports. Unset values are derived from the GPU index, so two jobs do not share a port. The judge NCCL port is the judge port + 1. Do not pick a port in 29500–29899; that range is reserved for model-server NCCL |
| `MODEL_PATH` | `$FDB_WORK/models/MiniCPM-o-4_5` | Checkpoint directory of the model under test |
| `MODEL_REVISION` | `503e754…` | Recorded in the run manifest; must match `MODEL_PATH` |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT_S` | `90` | Per-session client deadline; the longest v1.5 input is about 18 s |
| `SCORING_VENV` | `$FDB_WORK/scoring-venv` | Venv that runs ASR, timing and the judge clients |

## Notes

- **`--repeat` only labels the directory.** It does not repeat the run. `generate --repeat 1` and `generate --repeat 2` write `repeat-1/` and `repeat-2/` and leave each other alone. `generate --repeat N` also refuses to overwrite an existing `repeat-N/recording`. To redo that one invocation, delete `$FDB_WORK/runs/RUN_NAME/repeat-N` and rerun all three steps for the same N. `asr` and `judge` resume finished work when rerun.
- **Keep the settings fixed across the repeats of one run.** Never mix repeats with different pair selections, `--num-shards`, `SERVER_CONFIG` or judge; use a new `--run-name` instead.
- **`--num-shards` changes what you measure.** With `--num-shards 2`, two sessions share the GPU, so latencies are measured under load and are not comparable to one shard. It must not exceed `max_sessions` in `SERVER_CONFIG` (2 by default); extra connections are rejected with HTTP 503.
- **Repeats need sampling.** `minicpmo-parity.yaml` decodes greedily, so its repeats are nearly identical. Use it for regression checks against a fixed recording, not for variance.
- **The first 48 pairs are not a random sample.** `--per-subset 12` takes the first 12 samples of each category. This gives fast, comparable numbers between runs, but they are not full-dataset estimates.
- **Non-passing sessions are never dropped.** They count as ineligible in the denominators, and empty interval sets show as `n/a`, not zero.
- **Concurrent jobs use one GPU each.** Ports, the judge config directory and compile caches are derived from `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. The procedure is [Concurrent runs](#concurrent-runs).

## Scoring CLI reference

The subcommands wrap two CLIs: `benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_v15` records sessions, and `benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_reference` scores them with the official v1.5 ASR, timing and behavior code. Use them directly to score a recording outside the runbook. Run `eval "$(python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 env)"` first so the variables below are set. `record` needs the model server and `custom-judge` needs the judge server; start them in another terminal with `python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 serve-model` or `serve-judge`, which run in the foreground until Ctrl-C.

### Dependencies and source

The official scoring scripts and behavior prompt are not vendored. They are loaded from a [Full-Duplex-Bench checkout](https://github.com/DanielLin94144/Full-Duplex-Bench/tree/3e799c45a045256f47d5f1c9cda90157e2d2ec9e) at revision `3e799c45a045256f47d5f1c9cda90157e2d2ec9e`, and their SHA-256 is checked before every run. Their [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](https://github.com/DanielLin94144/Full-Duplex-Bench/blob/3e799c45a045256f47d5f1c9cda90157e2d2ec9e/LICENSE) applies.

The scoring venv uses Python 3.12, torch and torchaudio 2.11.0+cu130, NeMo 3.0.0, Silero VAD 6.2.1, numpy 2.5.3, scipy 1.18.1, soundfile 0.14.0, openai 3.28.0 and pydantic. Each phase records its actual package versions. No command downloads a model implicitly. ASR uses a local `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2` checkpoint at revision `ae9ad07059c7c739ffaf932226a8fe64ae2620b0`; its `.nemo` SHA-256 is `d99e39955c9d3d0350d8fb7c75e40c64a2b2eaeb003883d7c941fd2e8747b28c`.

### Record and export

```bash
OUT=results/fdb-manual
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_v15 record \
    --profile minicpmo-native-pr2377 \
    --dataset-root "$FDB_DATASET" --dataset-revision "$(cat "$FDB_WORK/dataset/v1.5.revision")" \
    --url "$REALTIME_URL" --model "$MODEL_ID" --model-revision "$MODEL_REVISION" \
    --server-revision "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --timeout "$SESSION_TIMEOUT_S" \
    --output "$OUT/recording"

python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_reference export \
    --engine model --trace-format realtime-pcm16-v1 --run "$OUT/recording" \
    --dataset-root "$FDB_DATASET" --out "$OUT/reference-audio"
```

`record` selects the full dataset by default; `--max-per-subset N` or repeated `--sample-id category/id` selects a subset. It exits 0 only when every selected session passes.

`export` cuts the fixed observation windows without changing the recording and needs a new output directory. `--dataset-root` counts every dataset sample that was not recorded as missing, so a subset run must also pass `--only category/id` for each selected pair. Repeated `--run` accepts disjoint shards; duplicate complete captures are rejected. `--engine` is a free label for the scored cohort.

### Score and resume

```bash
TREE=(--reference-source "$FDB_SOURCE" --tree "model=$OUT/reference-audio")
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_reference asr "${TREE[@]}" \
    --out "$OUT/scores" --nemo "$PARAKEET_NEMO" --nemo-sha256 "$PARAKEET_SHA256" --device cuda
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_reference timing "${TREE[@]}" \
    --out "$OUT/scores" --audio-loader soundfile
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_reference prepare-judge "${TREE[@]}" --out "$OUT/scores"
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_reference judge "${TREE[@]}" --out "$OUT/scores" \
    --judge gpt-4o-2024-08-06 --api-key-env OPENAI_API_KEY
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_reference summarize "${TREE[@]}" --out "$OUT/scores"
```

Run the phases in order against one output directory, with the same `--tree` mapping for each; repeat `--tree` to score several cohorts. CUDA ASR needs exactly one visible GPU. A rerun resumes from matching receipts. `--retry-failed` retries failed work units and keeps the earlier attempts; `--limit N` caps the work units of one invocation. Use a new output directory after changing the recording, the scoring configuration or the reference code. A zero exit means the phase finished, not that every sample qualified.

### Report

```bash
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_reference report --scores "$OUT/scores" --engine model
```

The report prints the selected and eligible populations, protocol verdicts, ASR and timing coverage, interval means, medians and confidence intervals, and the official behavior label distribution. It only reads `summary.json` and the manifest; it needs no GPU, checkpoint or API key, and does not rescore.

- `--replay replay.json` adds offline replay agreement. Format: `{"selected": N, "replayed": M, "samples": [{"sample": "category/id", "variant": "overlap", "recorded_status": "pass", "status": "match"}]}`. Each sample and variant must be unique and belong to the manifest.
- `--semantic-summary summary.json` adds the semantic quality section. It reads `scope`, `inputs_sha256`, `uncertainty_note`, `overall_axes` and `overall_joint`; each axis has `selected`, `accepted`, `failed` and `unresolved` counts. `benchmarks.duplex.semantic_judge` writes this file.

### Judges

Qwen3.8-27B served by `sglang serve` is the recommended judge, for both the behavior labels (`custom-judge`) and the semantic judge. It is local, pinned and reproducible. `judge` and `serve-judge` start it and write its config and launch receipt first.

GPT-4o (`judge`) is the paper's judge. Set the API key in `OPENAI_API_KEY`, never in a command argument or manifest; `--base-url` selects a compatible endpoint. The judge sends the exact reference prompt with seed 1 and keeps at most three attempts. A response from a model other than `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, a malformed label or a failed request is not a valid label, and no fallback judge is used. Without a key the labels stay pending, and `summarize` still runs.

### Custom behavior judge

`custom-judge` sends the exact reference prompt to a self-hosted model. Its labels are non-official and never replace GPT-4o labels. `--source-scores` reads an existing scoring directory; `--out` must be a separate new directory, and source files are never modified.

```bash
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_reference custom-judge "${TREE[@]}" \
    --source-scores "$OUT/scores" --out "$OUT/judge-qwen" \
    --judge-config "$JUDGE_CONFIG" --base-url "$JUDGE_URL"
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_duplex_reference custom-summarize "${TREE[@]}" \
    --source-scores "$OUT/scores" --out "$OUT/judge-qwen" \
    --judge-config "$JUDGE_CONFIG"
```

The config written by `judge` and `serve-judge` is `$JUDGE_CONFIG`, which is `$FDB_WORK/judge/port-$JUDGE_PORT/judge-config.json`. Each judge port has its own directory, so two concurrent jobs do not overwrite one config:

```

Both revisions must be 40-character commit hashes. `temperature`, `top_p` and `max_tokens` are required; `top_k`, `min_p`, `repetition_penalty` and `enable_thinking` are sent only when set, so omit any the endpoint does not support. The launch receipt, a path relative to the config, records the server command, runtime version, checkpoint and tokenizer revisions and precision. The client checks its hash, because the returned model name alone does not prove which checkpoint was loaded. Put the endpoint key in `CUSTOM_JUDGE_API_KEY`, or a placeholder such as `EMPTY` for an endpoint without authentication.

Matching reruns skip finished samples. A changed config or selection needs a new `--out`, and changed transcripts, audio or ASR receipts prevent reuse. `--retry-failed` retries only transport and parsing failures. Wrong models, invalid labels and non-`stop` finishes stay invalid. Label shares use valid labels only, and the per-category Wilson 95% intervals describe dataset sampling, not human agreement or generation variance.

### Measurement definitions

- **Input pacing.** Audio is sent in 80 ms packets. Every packet start must stay within 80 ms of its source cadence, otherwise the session is ineligible. This bounds transport jitter only.
- **Observation window.** The output is scored over `[0, T]`, where T is the input length, anchored at the first input send. Received audio plays first-in first-out with no buffer, so initial delay, gaps and queueing remain. Audio still queued at T is cut, and the rest is silence; the result is mono 16 kHz PCM16 with exactly the input sample count. Errors inside the window make the session ineligible; silence is a valid output.
- **Intervals.** The official timing code merges VAD speech spans with 0.6 s (user) and 0.5 s (model) gaps. Stop intervals are overlaps of user and model spans. Response intervals run from a user span end to the next strictly later model span start. These are whole-file intervals, not event-local latencies. `summary.json` reports their pooled means and medians with sample-cluster bootstrap CIs.
- **Missing values.** Empty interval sets and missing labels are null, never zero latency or 0%. Counts keep every selected, eligible, invalid and unscored sample.
- **Limits.** Simulated playout is not acoustic latency, and the fixed window can cut long replies. One generation per sample does not estimate generation variance. Prosody and MOS are not covered.

### Verification

The unit tests cover export, missing samples, valid silence, timing, ASR deduplication, bounded judging and resumption. With the pinned checkout they also run the official formulas on synthetic fixtures, without a GPU or API. Run them from the sglang-omni venv:

```bash
FDB_REFERENCE_SOURCE="$FDB_SOURCE" python -m pytest -q \
    tests/unit_test/benchmarks/test_duplex_reference*.py
```

Export is deterministic: re-exporting a recording reproduces every eligible WAV byte for byte, and re-summarizing saved transcripts and intervals reproduces the same summaries, including coverage and bootstrap intervals.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `ERROR: the model server did not become ready` (or the judge server) | The message ends with the last lines of the server log; the full log is `repeat-N/logs/model-server.log` or `repeat-N/logs/judge-server.log` |
| `ERROR: something already serves ...` | Another server holds the port, often a leftover from an interrupted run or a second job on the same GPU. Stop it, or give this job a different `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` / `SERVER_PORT` / `JUDGE_PORT` |
| `ERROR: .../recording exists` | That repeat was already generated; use the next `--repeat` or delete the directory |
| `ERROR: .../sample-ids.txt selects different pairs` | An earlier repeat of this run used another selection; pass the same selection options, or use a new `--run-name` |
| A shard log reports `fail` or `error` sessions | They stay in the denominator. Read `repeat-N/logs/record-shard-*.log`. If most sessions fail, fix the server and redo the repeat |
| HTTP 503 in record logs | `--num-shards` is larger than `max_sessions` in `SERVER_CONFIG` |
| `--device cuda needs exactly one visible GPU` | `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` (or `GPU`, when the former is unset) must be a single index |
| `ERROR: set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to exactly one GPU index` | A concurrent job must see one card. `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` in one terminal and `=1` in the other |
| `ERROR: GPU and CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES disagree` | Unset `GPU`, or set it to the same index as `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` |
| `asr` or `judge` prints `WARNING: a phase reported failures` | Rerun the command the warning prints; it is the same step with `--retry-failed` |
| `custom judge identity changed; use a new --out` | The judge config changed since this repeat was judged (for example, a different SGLang version). Delete `repeat-N/judge-qwen` and rerun `judge` for that repeat |
| `Control check failed: this judge configuration is not accepted.` | The judge missed a control case; the printed lines show which. Do not grade with this configuration. Check that the judge server runs the pinned Qwen3.8-27B revision |
| `... changed since this directory was created; use a new --out` | The semantic judge settings, prompt or inputs changed since this repeat was graded. Delete `repeat-N/semantic-qwen` and rerun `judge` for that repeat |
| `model_mismatch` with `JUDGE=gpt` | The endpoint returned a model name other than `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`; use an endpoint that serves exactly that model |
| `model-server.log` ends with `No module named 'onnx'` (or `einops`) | Rerun `setup`; it installs the `minicpm-o` extra into the active venv |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` in `asr` | Rerun `setup`; it reinstalls the scoring venv packages |

## Concurrent runs

Open two terminals. Paste one block into each. Start both immediately; neither waits for the other. Each terminal keeps the sglang-omni venv active (`which python` prints that interpreter) and runs every line itself. Do not set `SERVER_PORT` or `JUDGE_PORT`. The model port is `8097 + 10×GPU` and the judge port is `30000 + 10×GPU`. The judge NCCL port is the judge port + 1. The judge config is `$FDB_WORK/judge/port-<judge port>/`. Compile caches are under `$FDB_WORK/cache/gpu-<index>/`.

The first line from `generate` must be exactly the `Job GPU ...` line written under that terminal. GPU 0 is model port 8097, judge port 30000, judge NCCL port 30001. GPU 1 is model port 8107, judge port 30010, judge NCCL port 30011. A shell startup helper may have exported `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` already; the `export` in the block replaces it. `unset GPU` is required when that variable is set to a different index.

Terminal 1:

```bash
cd <path/to/sglang-omni>
export FDB_WORK="${FDB_WORK:-$HOME/fdb}"
unset GPU SERVER_PORT JUDGE_PORT
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 generate --run-name minicpmo-30-t1 --repeat 1 --per-subset 30
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 asr --run-name minicpmo-30-t1 --repeat 1
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 judge --run-name minicpmo-30-t1 --repeat 1
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 aggregate --run-name minicpmo-30-t1
```

`generate` prints `Job GPU 0: model port 8097, judge port 30000 (nccl 30001), judge config /data/chenyang/fdb/judge/port-30000` when `FDB_WORK` is `/data/chenyang/fdb`. `aggregate` writes `$FDB_WORK/runs/minicpmo-30-t1/RESULTS.md`.

Terminal 2:

```bash
cd <path/to/sglang-omni>
export FDB_WORK="${FDB_WORK:-$HOME/fdb}"
unset GPU SERVER_PORT JUDGE_PORT
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 generate --run-name minicpmo-30-t2 --repeat 1 --per-subset 30
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 asr --run-name minicpmo-30-t2 --repeat 1
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 judge --run-name minicpmo-30-t2 --repeat 1
python -m benchmarks.duplex.fdb_v15 aggregate --run-name minicpmo-30-t2
```

`generate` prints `Job GPU 1: model port 8107, judge port 30010 (nccl 30011), judge config /data/chenyang/fdb/judge/port-30010` when `FDB_WORK` is `/data/chenyang/fdb`. `aggregate` writes `$FDB_WORK/runs/minicpmo-30-t2/RESULTS.md`.

A third terminal is the same block with `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2`, `--run-name minicpmo-30-t3`, model port 8117 and judge port 30020. Do not point two terminals at the same `--run-name`.
