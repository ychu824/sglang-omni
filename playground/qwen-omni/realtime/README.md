# Wire Service — /v1/realtime web demo

![preview](preview.png)

Editorial-broadsheet single-page client for `/v1/realtime`. Captures
the microphone and streams PCM16 chunks to the WebSocket. The user can select
text-only output or text plus streamed PCM16 audio. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no
build step.

## Run

1. **Start the server** with one of these configurations:

   Text output only (one GPU; matches the playground default):

   ```bash
   sgl-omni serve \
     --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
     --text-only \
     --port 8765 \
     --enable-realtime
   ```

   Text and audio output on one H200:

   ```bash
   sgl-omni serve \
     --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
     --variant speech-colocated \
     --name qwen3-omni-colocated-h200 \
     --image_encoder.gpu_memory_fraction 0.017 \
     --audio_encoder.gpu_memory_fraction 0.017 \
     --thinker.gpu_memory_fraction 0.769 \
     --talker_ar.gpu_memory_fraction 0.123 \
     --code2wav.gpu_memory_fraction 0.014 \
     --port 8765 \
     --enable-realtime
   ```

   Text and audio output on two GPUs:

   ```bash
   python examples/run_omni.py qwen3-speech-server \
     --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
     --gpu-thinker 0 \
     --gpu-talker 1 \
     --gpu-code-predictor 1 \
     --gpu-code2wav 1 \
     --port 8765 \
     --enable-realtime
   ```

2. **Serve this directory** over HTTP (browsers won't grant
   `getUserMedia` to `file://`):

   ```bash
   cd playground/qwen-omni/realtime
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```

3. **Open** <http://127.0.0.1:8080> in a modern browser. Choose an output mode
   and turn detector, click **Open Wire**, then **Begin Transmission**, and
   start speaking. The selections are locked for the duration of the
   connection. **Text + audio** requires one of the speech-server configurations.

## Test

Run the browser-side playback state regressions from the repository root:

```bash
node --test playground/qwen-omni/realtime/playback.test.js
```

## What you'll see

| UI panel | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Endpoint** | WebSocket endpoint to connect to. |
| **Output** | Defaults to **Text only**, which requests `["text"]` and displays the assistant reply followed by the user's verbatim transcript. **Text + audio** requests `["text", "audio"]`, plays the streamed spoken response, and displays only the assistant reply. |
| **Turn Detection** | Smart Turn v3 semantic endpointing or fixed-silence `server_vad`. |
| **Semantic Eagerness** | Controls how readily semantic VAD ends a turn. Defaults to the medium preset. |
| **Instructions** | System prompt sent in `session.update`. Affects the assistant reply only — transcription always runs verbatim. |
| **Responses** | Each VAD-driven turn appears as a card. Assistant text is rendered from `response.text.delta`; text-only mode also renders `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta`. |

## Notes

- Turn detection is always server-side; there's no manual commit. The page
  waits for `session.created.capabilities` before requesting semantic VAD.
  Older servers and servers without a usable Smart Turn model safely use
  `server_vad`.
- Semantic VAD scores each pause once after 160 ms. Medium eagerness commits
  after 250 ms for high-confidence completion or 640 ms for normal completion;
  low-confidence pauses use the 2-second hard stop.
- Set `SGLANG_OMNI_SMART_TURN_MODEL_PATH` to a local BSD-2 licensed
  [Smart Turn v3.2](https://huggingface.co/pipecat-ai/smart-turn-v3)
  `smart-turn-v3.2-gpu.onnx` file or its containing directory before server
  startup. The runtime never downloads the model and verifies its SHA-256.
- The page constructs its own `AudioWorklet` inline so there's no build
  step / package.json required.
- Audio is captured at 16 kHz, converted to PCM16 little-endian, and
  base64-encoded into `input_audio_buffer.append` frames.
- Text-only mode requests only the `text` modality.
- Text + audio mode requests both modalities. Audio deltas are mono 24 kHz
  PCM16 little-endian and are queued with Web Audio for gapless playback.
- Server-owned barge-in is the default behavior for text-plus-audio sessions.
  The server cancels the active response when new speech starts, while the
  browser stops queued PCM playback. The interrupted user transcription remains
  in conversation history before the next queued response starts. Cancelled
  assistant output is not retained.
- Text-only mode keeps its existing behavior and finishes the active response.
- Custom realtime applications get the same behavior by requesting
  `["text", "audio"]`. On `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`, they must stop
  buffered playback and reject later `response.audio.delta` events for the
  interrupted response until `response.done`. If speech starts before
  `response.created`, retain a pending-interruption flag and reject that response
  once its ID arrives.
- If playback is interrupted after assistant audio has been scheduled, send
  `conversation.item.truncate` with the assistant `item_id` from
  `response.audio.delta`, `content_index: 0`, and the played duration in
  `audio_end_ms`. The server replies with `conversation.item.truncated` and
  removes that assistant item from conversation history. It removes the whole
  assistant transcript because audio and text are not aligned.
- Automatic interruption ends with `response.done.status="cancelled"` and
  reason `turn_detected`; explicit `response.cancel` uses `client_cancelled`.
- To opt out for a specific audio session, set:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "session.update",
    "session": {
      "modalities": ["text", "audio"],
      "turn_detection": {
        "type": "server_vad",
        "interrupt_response": false
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Partial turn-detection updates preserve the active type and settings.
  Detector behavior changes rebuild the detector and clear pending input audio;
  changing `interrupt_response` does not.
- The standalone `/v1/audio/speech` TTS API is unchanged because it does not
  have a live microphone/VAD session to trigger barge-in.
- The page does no error handling beyond updating the status line —
  matching the project's house style. If the WS drops mid-session,
  reconnect.
