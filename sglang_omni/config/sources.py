"""The canonical user-facing surfaces for setting a configuration path.

Two spellings, one path language. In YAML, per-stage settings live under the
``stages:`` mapping, keyed by stage name::

    config_cls: MossTTSPipelineConfig
    model_path: OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS

    stages:
      tts_engine:
        tp_size: 2
        engine:
          mem_fraction_static: 0.7
      vocoder:
        model:
          dtype: bfloat16

On the command line the same paths appear as dotted flags, with the
``stages.`` prefix implied -- the flag starts from the stage name, exactly
as the mapping does::

    sgl-omni serve --config omni.yaml \\
        --tts_engine.tp_size 2 \\
        --tts_engine.engine.mem_fraction_static 0.7

Every stage name must be one the config class defines: stage topology --
which stages exist, how they route, where requests enter -- lives in the
model's ``config.py`` and is not user configuration. The file overrides
settings on those stages; every leaf it writes becomes one patch, so
provenance and conflict detection stay per value.

    equal config.
